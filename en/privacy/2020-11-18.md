#### Cookies

Our website may use so-called cookies. Cookies are little text files that are saved by your browser on your computer. Cookies don't do any damage to your computer and do not include viruses. We use cookies to make our services more user friendly, more effective and safer.

Most of the cookies we employ are so called “session cookies”. These are automatically deleted after the end of your visit. Other cookies stay on your device until you delete them. These cookies allow us to recognize your browser on your next visit.

You can adjust your browser so that you will be made aware of the placement of any cookies, will be able to allow or disable the placement of cookies individually, automatically disable all Cookies, or automatically delete all cookies at the end of your browser session. When cookies are disabled the functionality of this website may be restricted.

Cookies for the provision of the electronic communication-procedure or for the provision of certain desired functionalities are saved on basis of Art. 6 Sec. 1 lit. f DSGVO. Our legitimate interest in saving cookies lies in the facilitation of an error free technical delivery and the optimization of our services. If other cookies (for example cookies for the analysis of your browsing behaviour) are implemented, these will be treated separately in this privacy policy.
